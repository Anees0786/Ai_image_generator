# Image Generation Script

This Python script uses the OpenAI API and DALL-E to generate images based on textual descriptions. 

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Anees0786/Ai_image_generator
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash

    ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:
